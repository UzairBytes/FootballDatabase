# FootballDatabase
This was a project in CSC343: Introduction to Databases at the University of Toronto where we were allowed to choose any topic, find the data, clean it, put it into a Postgres (PSQL) database and interpret the results. We chose to evaluate certain football (soccer) statistics using a Kaggle dataset that can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer. Our phase1 involves setting up the relevant questions and establishing integrity constraints and a formal relational algebra schema. Phase2 and db.py shows how we imported the data. The other files deal with the questions, discussion of results, and some relevant data that we extracted by running many different queries (which, unfortunately, we don't have anymore).
